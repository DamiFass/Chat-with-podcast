# Chat with podcast
This is a repository for the implementation of a "chat-with-podcast" web app. The app, deployed with the use of Streamlit, is connected to a Weaviate vector database and answers any user question based on the relevant content from any of the podcast episode. The podcast series used as example is "The Impact Theory".

This repository was forked from the Uplimit course repository "Building RAG applications with LLMs".

The course teaches search and discovery industry best practices and had the developing of this Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application as final project. The final app consists in a question answering systew through an LLM and UI implementation through Streamlit. It builds up on the work done during the course, where we developed all the components of a RAG system, including: data preprocessing, embedding creation, vector database selection, indexing, retrieval systems, reranking and retrieval evaluation. 

The app is accessible ![here](https://chat-with-impact-theory.streamlit.app/).
